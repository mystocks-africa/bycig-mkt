## 🖥️ Setup

For development purposes, this project uses Docker. Docker ensures that all environment configurations are created properly by creating isolated images through Linux which allows developers to focus on things that actually matter. 

Before you start, ensure you have Docker installed on your computer. You can check my running the cmd:
```bash
docker -v
```

If your terminal returns an error, simply follow this link and install Docker Desktop, and everything will be configured.
[Click here!](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/)

There are multiple services within this project, so we need to run multiple containers. For seamless integration, we have used Docker Compose tooling. To use it, run the following cmds:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To stop all containers, run the following

```bash
docker-compose down
```
